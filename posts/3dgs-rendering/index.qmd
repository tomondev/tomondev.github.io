# Introduction


# Formulation

# Implementation

In this section, we will use a simple example to test the rendering effect. We will render a 3DGS scene stored in a [ply file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GzjaYGz2jGy-ACT4Kz45Axuykd8aXsz2/view?usp=sharing) created by [Scaniverse](https://scaniverse.com/).
